# Best Bus -- which one to take?
Many apps exist to use the Minneapolis/St. Paul transit system. I was inspired to make another one.

Why? I can choose different combinations of bus or LRT lines for many of the trips that I take, and I found that I spend too much time comparing them before walking to particular stop. I wanted to know immedialtey which way to start walking. 

These are my secondary goals:
* fast load: some areas have poor data reception, and reloads fail
* explicitly know reload status: I can't always tell when the page reloaded last, or will again
* small footprint app that can load on slow network and run on old devices

## Future Goals
Update to graphical styling.
